This project is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game created using Python. The game allows two players to play by taking turns placing X and O on a 3×3 board. The program checks for a winner after each move and determines if the game ends in a win or a draw.

**GAME OVERVIEW**
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a console-based two-player game made with Python. It is played on a 3×3 grid where two players take turns placing their symbols, X and O, on the board. Player X goes first. The goal is to be the first player to line up three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game checks for a winner after each move. It ends when a player wins or when all the spaces on the board are filled, resulting in a draw.
